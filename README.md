Napier Commission

Context
- The Napier Commission (Royal Commission of Inquiry into the Condition of Crofters and Cottars in the Highlands and Islands) was a inquiry into the condition of crofters and cottars in the Highlands and Islands of Scotland in the 1880s. 
- The commission was a response to crofter and cottar agitation in the Scottish Highlands due to high rents, lach of security of tenure, and removal of land.
- Interesting because you get to hear from the people themselves.

Goal and Scope
- The goal of this project is to create a tool that can be used by those interested in learning more about the Napier Commission without needing programming knowledge.
- The document is so long that reading through all of it would take a very long time.
- I will create a website that allows people to:
    -> filter by location manually and using a map
    -> create different types of graphs to analyze the Napier Commission (word usage, sentiment analysis)
